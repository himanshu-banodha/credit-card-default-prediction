# Credit Card Default Prediciton Project

# Overview
This is an end-to-end, Credit Card Default Prediction project aims to predict credit card defaults using machine learning techniques. The project is implemented in a modular fashion and deployed using Flask.

# Problem statement
Financial threats are displaying a trend about the credit risk of commercial banks as the incredible improvement in the financial industry has arisen. In this way, one of the biggest threats face by commercial banks is the risk prediction of credit clients. The goal is to predict the probability of credit default based on credit card owner's characteristics and payment history.

# Approach 
The classical machine learning tasks like Data Exploration, Data Cleaning, Feature Engineering, Model Building and Model Testing. Try out different machine learning algorithms thatâ€™s best fit for the above case.

# Dataset Information
This dataset contains information on default payments, demographic factors, credit data, history of payment, and bill statements of credit card clients in Taiwan from April 2005 to September 2005.
There are 25 columns, and 30,000 rows.

# Built With

# Installation
Follow these steps to install & set up the project.
1.	Clone the Repository

    * Open your terminal / command prompt.
```
git clone https://github.com/himanshu-banodha/credit-card-default-prediction.git
```
2.	Create & Activate Virtual Environment (Optional but recommended)
   
    * It is a good practice to create a virtual environment to manage the project
```
conda create -p <Environment_Name> python==<python version> -y
```
```
conda activate <Environment_Name>/
```
3.	Install the required dependencies
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
4.	Run the project
```
python app.py
```
5.	Open your web browser and navigate to:
